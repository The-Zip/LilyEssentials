## Information
Hey guys, The_Zip here. Unfortunately bobacadodl has left the Minecraft community to more personal real life stuff. Because of this, he has given me the LilyEssentials source code, and I am updating it. If you are familiar with the LilyPad code, and would like to help me out, send me a message.

Huge thanks to these people, give them a thanks, like all there post's, and give them lots of love:
Tzeentchful - Fixing more than half the code, and adding hide.
matthijs110 - Helping me out with Jenkins!

### Config
LilyEssentials now has completely configurable message formats!
The placeholders(when applicable) are ```{message}```, ```{player}```, ```{players}```, and ```{server}```.
you can also use color codes with &(0-9,a-f,k-o)

#### New feature: large-mode
This is an option in config which will make lilyessentials run much faster on large servers. It also includes benefits such as better error handling (tells you if a player is offline when you try to message them, etc.)

However, if you are a smaller server (<50 players), it may be slightly slower to use this.

DISCLAIMER: large-mode has not been thoroughly tested, but it should work fine :)â€‹
